A detailed academic calendar is available on the website and notice-boards of the Departments.For theory courses, internal exams like Unit test and Prelim are conducted during each semester. The answer sheets of internal examinations are distributed to the students after evaluation to find out discrepancies. If any kind of discrepancy is found,students convey it to the concerned teacher. The necessary corrections are carried out by the concerned teacher and conveyed tothe examination coordinator.In Laboratory courses, assessment is done in each laboratory session and marks are given for performance, understanding and timely submission of experiment and record is maintained in Progressive practical internal assessment record.

For each course in particularsemester unit test examinations are conducted.The PO attainment is done by assessment of each course outcomes for every course. The attainment of CO is computed for all courses in each program usually with 80% weightage for direct assessment and 20 % weightage for indirect  assessment. Therefore, CO Attainment = 80% Direct Assessment + 20% Indirect Assessment. Indirect Assessment consists of Unit test performance, Prelim exam performance, University Result and Continuous Assessment whereas Course Exit Survey is only considered as the tool for indirect assessment. For Unit Test Exam, students securing more than 60% marks are set to have attainment level of 3, students securing more than 50% but less than 60% are set to have attainment level of 2 whereas students securing more than 40% marks but less than 50% are set to have attainment level of 1."

The effectiveness of each policy decision is tracked and reported to the institution's leadership for further action. The following is the entire procedure: At regular intervals, all stakeholders' feedback is collected and given to the IQAC for future remedial action. Based on the feedback reports received, IQAC examines the varied requirements of external stakeholders such as companies, AICTE, and UGC. IQAC decides academic policies that will be transferred to the Institute and departments based on these variables. Academic auditing organisations such as NAAC, NBA, DTE, AICTE, LMC, UGC, and CII visit institutes to ensure quality. External stakeholder, institute, and department attributes are all taken into account by IQAC. Student Training Programs (STP) are promoted while taking into account the academic level of the students. The desired outcome begins with improving soft skills and finishes with the organization's Value Added Programs (VAP). These not only assist students improve their verbal and communicative skills, but they also extend their perspective on market conditions and industry demand. This aids in the bridge building process between academia and industry. Through VAP, guest lectures, and webinars, experts from various fields share their insights with students. The SKNCOEEntrepreneurship Cell was established in order to support young aspiring entrepreneurs who are enthusiastic about business development."

IQAC plans to hold programmes to assist students and staff in developing these abilities. 2. It is critical to assist one another during and after the epidemic, particularly the most vulnerable members of society. The IQAC intends to expand the college's outreach initiatives. 3. NEP has revolutionised education in ways never seen before. The college should be better equipped for NEP, according to IQAC. The college has already created a NEP committee, and in the future, the focus will be on scaling up these efforts. 4. Everyone is thinking about when and how to safely reopen the institution without jeopardising public health. The IQAC wants to make sure that the institution reopens safely while also ensuring that resources are spent appropriately in the most critical areas. Infrastructure development will be critical, and IQAC will work to achieve this goal. 5. Creating more official MoUs with other universities and colleges would increase knowledge transfer, and the IQAC will benefit."
